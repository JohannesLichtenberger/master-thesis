% This template is based on LLNCS.DEM, the demonstration file of the LaTeX macro 
% package from Springer-Verlag for Lecture Notes in Computer Science, version 2.2 for
% LaTeX2e (see llncs.dem for usage information).
% The template uses the additional definitions based on the master-thesis of Alexander 
% Holupirek (University of Konstanz) and Thomas Zink (University of Konstanz).
% 
% This template was adapted and generalized by Sebastian Kay Belle (University of
% Konstanz) as a generic template for bachelor and master theses (at least for the
% students of the distributed systems laboratory).
