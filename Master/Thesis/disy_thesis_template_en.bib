  abstract = {In this paper trade-offs among certain computational factors in hash
	coding are analyzed. The paradigm problem considered is that of testing
	a series of messages one-by-one for membership in a given set of
	messages. Two new hash- coding methods are examined and compared
	with a particular conventional hash-coding method. The computational
	factors considered are the size of the hash area (space), the time
	required to identify a message as a nonmember of the given set (reject
	time), and an allowable...},
